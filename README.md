# The Lost Nemo - HTML Code Repository

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Disclaimer
This repository contains HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files from my **Glitch.com** project, which is related to **The Lost Nemo**. However, I do **not** own The Lost Nemo‚Äîit's iHemo's property, and I'm not trying to impersonate them! This is just a personal project that shares some elements.

## üìÇ What‚Äôs Inside?
- Various **HTML files** for different pages
- **CSS styles** that make things look nice
- **JavaScript scripts** for added functionality

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Additional info
- All in one big (pile of crap) mess 
- Nothing is organized (at all)
- Just (possibly) helpful comments 

## üöÄ Live Version

*(If this disappears one day, it's probably because I pushed my luck...)*
